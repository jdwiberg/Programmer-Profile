I am an undergraduate Computer Science student and Varsity Athlete at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), in the class of 2026. I previously attended Sacred Heart University where I also studied computer science and played baseball.

My focus is on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence applications, with projects spanning natural language processing, large-scale data analysis, LLM training, and more general AI algorithms. I have significant experience working with and implementing programs in Python and PyTorch.

Right now, I am working with HaystackID, a company specializing in eDiscovery solutions, to research methods of performing entity extraction on large legal datasets. We are exploring the efficacy of more traditional strategies using NLP and other deterministic algorithms, as well as newer strategies using both open-source and locally trained LLMs.

I also have experience in other programming languages and domains. In other projects, I have performed data extraction from large datasets using SQL, front-end web development using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, as well as work in other languages such as C, C++, and Java.

I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in AI/ML software engineering starting Summer 2026.

Besides being a student and a programmer, I have many other hobbies. I am currently in my final year of collegiate baseball. I played 2 years of Division 1 ball as a pitcher at Sacred Heart University, and am now in my second year as a pitcher and outfielder for WPI. 

I am also now a bit of a world traveler. I recently found the time (and money) to check a few countries off my list, including Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, Vatican City, and Canada. When traveling, I enjoy nature-related activities like camping and hiking, and I try to learn as much as I can of any languages I might hear.

Lastly, I've recently become an aspiring musician. I mostly make and play country/folk style music on my Taylor acoustic guitar, but I've recently gotten my hands on a Fender Stratocaster and have been playing a ton of Pink Floyd.
